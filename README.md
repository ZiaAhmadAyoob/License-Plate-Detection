## 🔍 Problem Statement
Manual identification of vehicle number plates is time-consuming and inefficient, especially in traffic monitoring and surveillance systems. This project automates number plate detection using deep learning.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Detect vehicle license number plates from images
- Support intelligent traffic monitoring systems
- Provide a simple web-based interface for model inference

---

## 🧠 Model & Dataset
- **Model:** YOLOv11 (Ultralytics)
- **Task:** Object Detection
- **Class:** License Plate
- **Dataset:** Custom / public number plate dataset
- **Annotation Format:** YOLO

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv11
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit

---

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. Dataset collection and annotation
2. Model training using YOLOv11
3. Performance evaluation using Precision, Recall, and mAP
4. Deployment using Streamlit Cloud
